Activize: Enterprise Fitness with IOT

According to a research report, The Human Cloud at Work: A Study Into The Impact Of Wearable Technologies In The Workplace1, which was spearheaded by Dr. Chris Brauer of the Institute of Management Studies at Goldsmiths, University of London and Rackspace, wearable technology could boost employee productivity and job satisfaction. On the high end, ABI Research estimates the wearable market to be around 485 million annual devices shipments by 2018, whereas IMS Research more conservatively projects annual device shipments to be around 50 million units annually2. Although there is almost tenfold disparity between the two, even the low-end indubitably represents an expansive IOT market. Organizations will necessitate a cloud solution to handle and process the large volume of wearable devices data collected from their employees. As for privacy, with the advent of social media and mobile devices, individuals have expressed less concern over sharing their data. For example, Socimetric Solutions says that as many as 90 percent of employees agree to use smart badges that measure employeesâ€™ movements, their tone of voice, where they are in an office, and to whom they are talking.
